# Insert Special Symbol

This extension is fairly straight-forward: it allows you to insert symbols that are otherwise hard to enter with a normal keyboard.

Contributions and suggestions are very welcome.

## Features

```replaceSelection```

This command replaces the current selection(s) with the corresponding value in a lookup table.
For instance, `pi` becomes `π` and `rho` becomes `ρ`.

As of version *1.1*, there are some replacements available for the following categories:
- Greek
- Mathematics
- Set theory
- Formal logic
- Arrows
- Culture

You may also replace a hexadecimal Unicode escape sequence such as `\u03b1`.
